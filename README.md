# OSCC_HPLM
 
Welcome to OSCC HPLM culture project!


In recent years, human plasma like medium (HPLM) have been developed that mimic the conditions of the human physiology. In comparison with conventional cell culture medium, cell culture in HPLM had extensive effects on cellular metabolism, including metabolome, redox status, and glucose utilization. However, molecular mechanisms underlying HPLM effects on human cells are only partly understood. Transcriptome and chromatin accessibilities are important regulators of cell states and implicate in a variety of biological processes. We habituated three oral cancer cell lines such as SAS, HSC-3, and HSC-4 in HPLM and evaluated cell growth, drug sensitivity, transcriptome and chromatin accesibilities.
